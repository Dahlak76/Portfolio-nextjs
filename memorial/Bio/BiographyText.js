					<p className={styles.articleParagraph}>I was born in Ethiopia (I’m Eritrean, that complicates things) into a privileged position by Ethiopian standards and in some ways, even American standards. I had access to education, relative safety, proximity to whiteness and many comforts that didn’t reach most of the population. I was the son of a pilot and a nurse and they were the only ones that worked for an industry other than themselves. Everyone else in my family, distant or otherwise, had their own—from owning small businesses to large corporations. I was raised to be a capitalist to an extent and later in my life I learned why.

Money was needed to fuel the revolution, and every member of my family was part of the resistance. If they weren’t in the field fighting or providing medical support, they were finding ways to fund the fight. Along with this, some of my relatives traveled overseas to gain support in any way possible. Half of my family was imprisoned as political prisoners—both men and women. Early on, I learned that women weren’t part of the revolution—they WERE the revolution and to this day I’m still learning about the struggles that each member of my family endured to get to the point where we are now.

My father, Teclai Keleta, was born in a mud hut village and worked his way up to becoming a pilot after leaving his home to live in larger cities. He educated his way from villager to mechanic, to working on flights, finally becoming a captain of the main, state-run airline. A source of pride for all those around him, he inspired others to follow in their footsteps and find their calling. Eventually those he inspired also found ways to be apart of the resistance. All of this took place during the early days of the war for independence against Haile Selassie (I struggle with Rastas that revere him). My kinfolk educated themselves during this time in efforts to find ways to dismantle the imperial regime.

<p className={styles.articleParagraph}>
In the mid seventies the emperor was killed by one of his top generals and a new “communist” regime was instated despite it being another dictatorship, through and through… The next seventeen years or so were times of terror, but they were also times of unity for many of us. People fled in droves while others left the country in search of safer areas to continue the fight. Others went to the fields to fight head-on. This was around the time when I was born. 
</p>
<p className={styles.articleParagraph}>
I know I’m giving y’all a book report here but this is a key part of my early life and generational history that radicalized me. My father was killed when I was about three years old. He was flying a cargo plane loaded with guns and such and was shot down. How and why it was him is another story, but if it wasn’t him in that plane it would’ve been another plane. Such is life in love and war I guess. My mother did not take to this well which led to the decision of relocating us to Italy in hopes of making a better life for us when I was six years old. We only stayed for about six months however before making the move to the United States. 
</p>
<p className={styles.articleParagraph}>
The next chapter of my radicalization begins here. In the U.S. I quickly learned that my  blackness was something I needed to be aware of. It was shocking to go from not having to acknowledge this aspect of my identity for it to suddenly be at the forefront of my life. It took years for me to understand this shift but the experience of it was instant. Along with this I endured feelings of awkwardness and confusion due to my mother’s mental decline.

					When I was 15, my mother and I went back to Eritrea to visit family when the war had ended and we finally had won our independence. She was excited to see her brothers and their wives and their children that all came back alive and also to see my grandparents. I was eager to see my grandparents. The last memory I had of him was in a prison when my grandmother and I would bring him food. I still remember the honey we used to bring him and the concrete wall slabs around us. He was sentenced to five years in prison for getting caught with a letter talking about financing the fight. I was about four or five back then. I remember knowing that they fave him a light sentence instead of death out of respect for him being an elder. I had no clue what I was learning. I’m still not sure. I was happy to see my mother happy. I was happy to see my grandparents again. I was happy to see all of these people that looked like me, happy. There was excitement in the air like it was the first time breathing air. I was there for 10 months celebrating freedom for my people. I was also fighting for my own freedom. My mother read out of meds a week after we got there and a lil’ ol’ country in East Africa didn’t have any meds that helped. I couldn’t travel back with my mother so all the adults decided I should also stay there. I fought. I rebelled. I did everything that would convince them to let me come back to America. Yeah, Stockholm Syndrome is a mf.

Fast forward a few years of going from a planned life of a “professional” to hitchhiking across the states for a couple of years. After getting arrested a few times I end up in New Orleans in my late teens. Had my run of parties did my fair share of drugs and participated in enough criminal matters to end me up going to jail. After some back and forth, running out of money and connections,, I finally did some time. 2.5 out of a 3 year sentence for paraphernalia that should’ve been a misdemeanor with a max of six months in jail. The current DA, Cannizzaro, was my judge at the time. Came out and legally hustled and worked my way to some comfortable existence and lived. All I wanted was to forget my everything and be in peace.

<p className={styles.articleParagraph}>
That never happened. Not a single day. Every day I was black and every day I was and still am, a fucking disenfranchised felon in America. Everyday was a day I couldn’t stand. I’ve always dreamt of taking down this gov and every corporation and every institution that upholds this very bullshit. Every religious symbol and system is a reminder of why I love fire so much. I was full of rage and still am. For many years after that prison stint I just tried to be normal. Be part of this decrepit system and numb the rage. I did okay for awhile. Then ICE came and locked me up. Three more months locked up wondering if my case would “win” and free me. I won a little something, I got an active deportation order BUT got a withholding of removal because I could prove how bad it would be for me if I went back. It’s a win but even that win is a prison. After that release and a few years of not fighting the system, I went full fuck-it mode and started back in a life of drugs, guns, and “financial” crimes. Credit cards, bank fraud and the like. It was great joy knowing ways that I could live my life at the expense of imaginary “money” at the expense of banks. Fun while it lasted.Went to prison for a five year sentence. Three years in an extension camp of Angola where I worked my way up to a trusty and worked directly for the warden of the prison. This was a person that was a hybrid state “but run by a private prison group” (geo group).

Afterwards, 1 year in a work release camp which was the closest to slavery that I’ve ever known. As bad if not worse than prison itself.f And one year of parole after. I should rewind back to the three years part. During that time I was recruited to be part of a leadership group by some brothers that saw potential in me. There’s all sorts of “programs” and groups that focus on music, sports, faith-based, etc. I was fortunate enough to get plucked by some black men in prison the were guiding other black men to not just be better but to educate others to understand the systems at play and to work towards change. I’ve never organized before but instantly, I was now in a position to speak what I knew and felt. There were so many brothers that were eloquent and charismatic and know how to raise a fucking roof. I aimed to learn from them.

<p className={styles.articleParagraph}>
I was able to learn from them. I was able to share knowledge and understanding. History and experience. A solid desire to move us forward. In turn, I learned from them in the ways to fight a most oppressive system behind bars. We led hunger strikes and work strikes. I won’t say they were a success, they weren’t. We crumbled under their full weight and influence. I have to take responsibility and admit it was due to our leadership that couldn’t keep the momentum going. We failed at conveying and convincing of the power of solidarity. We thought that our ability to mobilize and educate was enough. It wasn’t. We failed at solidifying rest.ve to hang strong through time. Resolve enough to withstand their pushback. Each time we failed at our objective I took it hard. I hesitate to say I was part of leadership then because there were so many there that were amazing at what they did. And didn’t include myself in the progress but felt central in how we failed. When I had doubts in myself, I was constantly reminded of what each of us brought to the table. I was taught that we all need to play our parts no matter how many parts we had to play. I learned a lot from my brothers then that I still find strengths from. I can proudly say that prison was where I learned to organize. I still struggle at calling myself an organizer though. Organizing out here is a different animal and I’m learning the ways from others again.

I loved working in the wardens office, the masters house per say. I used the fuck out of it to benefit my people behind the fence. I used my ability to navigate in White circles and my proximity to whiteness to help create better situation for prisoners. All the benefits I received from that went to my people. The group still runs as it did before me as well as after. 
</p>
<p className={styles.articleParagraph}>
Since my release in 2016, I’ve chilled in ways of reflection and observation. Dealt with the issues that come from being black, felon, as well as an immigrant with an active deportation order. In some ways I’m luckier than many. I don’t take my experiences lightly and I’ve worked to not take them heavier than I should. I’ve since labored on finding ways to ground myself and channel my energies to more constructive ways. I’m educating myself, I’m finding ways to accept that this is the world I live in while this is also the world I want to dismantle.
