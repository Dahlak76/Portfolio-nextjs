    comment:'Dahlak was my homie and comrade in coding. We endured hours of working on projects together in the hope of one day achieving financial stability. He had a childlike air to him that made it easy for us to become friends. I will cherish the lessons in humility I learned from him the rest of my life',

    comment: 'Dahlak always had a profound smile, one that\'s not easily forgotten. I praise God for that smile because it makes it easy for me to remember him. He was always easy-going , always sturdy, always steady. Always stable and strong, knowing what needed to happen on a nana by nana second basis. He was two steps ahead of most people, in terms of what needed to be done in terms of making the situation better , he didnâ€™t have ideas and determined outcomes of his own. And yet when you got to know him, he was very serious about issues of deep concern in his heart. His warm heart, action and touch was always uplifting. He was a king of the commonwealth because of his compassion in every situation. I never saw him not have time for other people who were around. He is sorely and dearly missed.'
